# Chapter 2 -  Starting Holos

Holos operates in one of two modes called “Basic” and “Advanced”.  As their names imply, they tailor the Holos experience for different needs.  If you do not need all the functionality that Holos offers and would rather get a summary of your farm’s emissions, then it is recommended to use the “Basic” mode.  If you want to get the most out of Holos with detailed results, then the “Advanced” mode is for you. 

By default, Holos starts with "Advanced Mode" enabled. However, you can easily switch to basic mode using the settings menu. To learn how to switch between each mode, [click here](#how-do-i-switch-between-advanced-and-simple-mode).

Holos can handle multiple farms created by the user, each representing different farming scenarios for example.  The user can experiment with what management practices do well together or determine what crops to grow together based on their potential yield and green-house emissions. 

<br>

## Creating a new farm

1. On every Holos start-up you either create a new farm or open an existing farm or import a farm from file.  Figure  2.1 displays the interface you are greeted with on every start-up. Your initial start-up of Holos after installation will skip this screen and send you to step two, automatically selecting “New” for you, to begin the creation process. 

<br>

		</em>
</p>
<br>


2. Please enter a name for the farm you would like to create in the “Name” section and add any additional comments in the “Comments” section. When you are finished, click the “OK” button to proceed.

<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter2/figure2-2.png" alt="Figure 2-2" width="650"/>
    <br>
    <em> Figure 2.2 Enter a name for your farm and any comments.</em>
</p>


3. You can also choose between “Metric” or “Imperial” from the drop-down list in the next screen. After you have chosen your unit of measurement, click the “Next” button on the bottom of the screen to proceed (figure 2.3).

<p align="center">

			<br>
			 B: Click here once you have selected your Province.
		</em>
</p>
<br>

## Selecting farm location

1. On your screen, you will now see many regions for the province you selected. Each specific region is shaded in red.  You can adjust the magnification (i.e. zoom in/out) of the map by using your mouse wheel or by selecting the magnifying glass near the bottom of the screen. Please select the location of your farm by right-clicking on one of the regions (see figure 2.5). 

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter2/figure2-5.png" alt="Figure 2-5" width="650"/>
    <br>
    <em>Figure: 2.5 Hovering the mouse cursor over the regions on the map will display a tool tip near you mouse pointer.</em>
</p>
<br>

2. When you have successfully clicked on one of the regions, Holos will download the climate data directly from NASA.  A progress bar will display the progress in downloading the data, it should only take a few seconds.   The details of that region will be displayed on the right side of the screen (Only for “Advanced Mode” see figure 2.6). You will see the location details, soil and hardiness zones, and climate details for the location you have selected. 

<br>
<p align="center">

		<br>
		D: The details of the soil zones, hardiness zones and climate details for your chosen location will be shown here.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

3. If the region you have selected has multiple soil types, please select the appropriate option for your farm based on either the predominant soil type in your area or the location of farming activities/management practices. The selected option will appear darker to indicate that it has been selected. 

<br>

    <br>
    <em>Figure: 2.7 Soil Zone Selection.</em>
</p>
<br>

4. If the region you have selected has multiple hardiness zones, please select the appropriate option for your farm. The selected option will appear shaded to indicate that it has been selected. To see the list of hardiness zones, please click on the tab at the top that says, “Hardiness Zones”.

<br>
<p align="center">

		A: Select the Hardiness Zone Tab, Soil Zone Tab, or the Climate Data Tab to see the available options.
		<br>
		B: Please select your hardiness zone here.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

5. Each region you select has access to the climate data.  Holos will load the appropriate climate data by default should you choose to ignore this tab.  If you would like to load custom data, you can load your own data from a file with “**.csv**” extension.  Holos will confirm your custom data is loaded

<br>
<p align="center">

		<br>
		C: If successful, you'll see a confirmation message.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

6. When you are finished selecting your soil type, hardiness zone and climate data, click “**Next**”.


<br>


## Formatting the custom climate data file

In order to import your own climate data into Holos, the file must be a Comma Separated Values (CSV) and have the ".csv" file extension. The file must also contain the following columns (headers are not case-sensitive and spaces are ignored when parsing):

* **Year** – The year the climate data is from. (format: YYYY, e.g. 2020)
* **Julian day** – The day based on the Julian Calendar. (integer: 1–366)
* **Mean daily air temperature** – The mean temperature of that day. (units: degrees Celsius, °C)
* **Mean daily precipitation** – The mean precipitation of that day. (units: millimetres, mm)
* **Mean daily potential evapotranspiration (PET)** – The mean potential evapotranspiration of that day. (units: millimetres, mm)

Optional columns:

* **Maximum air temperature** – The maximum temperature recorded for the day. (units: degrees Celsius, °C)
* **Minimum air temperature** – The minimum temperature recorded for the day. (units: degrees Celsius, °C)

Notes and examples:

- The parser matches columns by header name (case-insensitive) and ignores spaces, so the following header text are all acceptable: `MaximumAirTemperature`, `maximum air temperature`, `Maximum Air Temperature`, etc. The same applies to `MinimumAirTemperature`, `MeanDailyAirTemperature`, `MeanDailyPrecipitation`, and `MeanDailyPET`.
- Column order is flexible: the parser locates data by header names, so you may place the optional max/min columns anywhere in the header row.
- If both `MeanDailyAirTemperature` and `Maximum/MinimumAirTemperature` are provided, Holos will use the explicit mean from the `MeanDailyAirTemperature` column. If the mean is missing but both max and min are present, Holos computes the mean using `(max + min) /2`.
- All numeric values should use a period (`.`) as the decimal separator (for example `12.5`), and values should be provided in the units listed above. If your data is in different units, convert them before importing.

### New Farm

#### Creating a New Farm
- To create a new Farm file, click “New” under the “File” tab. This will allow you to create a new Farm following the steps in the sections “[Creating a New Farm](#creating-a-new-farm)” and “[Selecting a Farm Location](#selecting-farm-location)”. 
- 	If you do not know how to create a new farm, click here: [How to Create a New Farm](#creating-a-new-farm)
- 	If you do not know how to open a pre-existing farm, follow the instructions under **"Opening/Closing Files"**.

<br>

### Opening/Closing Files

#### Opening
1.	If you have saved previous farm files, you are able to open them by clicking “**Open**” under the “**File**” tab. 
2.	After you have clicked “**Open**”, a list of Farms that you have previously made will be shown with details such as the **Farm Name**, **Comments**, **Date Created** and **Date Modified.**
3.	The details of your farms can be **sorted by clicking on each header**. For example, by clicking on “**Name**” the Farm files will be sorted alphabetically and **the type of sort will be indicated by an up or down arrow** located beside the header name. **For example**, if we want the name of the farms to be sorted from A-Z, then click the “**Name**” header until an up arrow appears and vice-versa.

</p>
<br>

#### Closing

- To **close a file**, click “**Close**” under the “**File**” tab. This will automatically save your farm and exit the file and bring you back to the main screen where you can **create a new farm** or **open a pre-existing farm file**.

<br>

### Exporting/Importing Farm Configuration Files

You can export your farm configuration files to a JSON file (file extension ‘. json’) and then import them into Holos running on a different computer.  This only works for Holos 4, you cannot import old files from Holos 3 into Holos 4 and vice versa.

<br>

#### Exporting Farms

1.	To export a file, click on the “**Export Farm(s)**” icon under the “**File**” tab. This will open a window where you can see a list of farms that you can export. 
2.	You can **add a description** to each farm or modify the name of the farm by clicking on the appropriate box and modifying its contents. 
3. Click on the **farm**(s) you would like to include and click “**Export**” at the bottom to **choose a location for your exported file. The selected farm(s) will appear shaded*.*

	</em>
</p>
<br>

#### Exporting Climate Data Files

You can export your farms' climate data to a CSV file (file extension ‘. csv’), which can be viewed in software like Excel.  

1.	To export a file, click on the “**Export Climate Data**” icon under the “**File**” tab. This will open a window where you can see a list of farms that you can export. 
2.	You can **add a description** to each farm or modify the name of the farm by clicking on the appropriate box and modifying its contents. 
3. Click on the **farm**(s) you would like to include and click “**Export**” at the bottom to **choose a location for your exported file. The selected farm(s) will appear shaded*.*
4.	After you have selected your farm(s) and have clicked the “**Export**” button. You will be prompted to **choose a location where you would like the file to be created**. 
5.	You can **navigate** through your system with the tabs on the left side of the screen. 
6.	You can also **add a new folder** in the current location by **clicking on the “New Folder” button** at the top left of your screen. 
7.	You can **modify the name** of your file by **clicking in the section where it says “File name:”** at the bottom of your screen.
8. Click “**Save**” to finish once you have selected a location

Note that these instructions are similar to the instructions for [Exporting](#exporting) a farm. This is because the interface for and functionality of these export
options are nearly identical. 
<br>
The main functional difference is exporting multiple farms will result in a single .json file, whereas exporting the climate
data for multiple farms results in multiple .csv files. 
<br>
When exporting the climate data for multiple farms, step 4 in the process outlined above will repeat for the amount of farms you have chosen to export climate data for.

#### Save As

1.	If you already have a farm created but you would like to save it under another name and change it from there you can select “Save As”.  Like other products you might use “Save As” is a way of creating a copy.  Simply select “Save As” from the “File” tab and enter a name to save your new farm under.  
2.	Holos will warn you if the name already exists and will prompt you to change the name.
3.	You can now access this newly copied farm the same way you would open a farm from the “File” tab.

<br>

### Managing Farms

In this section, you can see all the farms that are in the current file you are working on. You will see a list of each farm and their information. **You can remove your farms in this tab and modify some of their information.**

1.	Click on the “**Farms**” icon under the “**File**” header at the top of the screen.
2.	A window will pop up displaying each farm in the file. Each section of the farm such as **Name, Comments, Date Created and Date Modified** can be changed by clicking on the appropriate box and modifying its contents
3. To **remove a farm**, select the farm you would like to remove by clicking on it and then click the “**Remove**” button at the bottom of the screen

### Modifying a Default Diet

To modify one of the default diets in Holos for a specific animal group and management period, it is best to make a copy of the default diet and then alter the data inputs for the copy. 

1. Open the Custom Diet Creator and Click on “**Yes**” for “**Show Default Diets**”. 
2. In the list of default diets below, right-click on the diet of interest and click “**Create a Copy**”.
3. You can change the name of the copy diet, if needed. 
4. you can alter the % of the different ingredients in the diet or delete specific ingredients, and you can add ingredients.
5. Once you have finished modifying the diet, click ‘OK’ to return to the main Diet tab and select the copied diet from the drop-down Diet menu.

Please note: if the user selects the same diet (either the original default diet or a copy) for more than one management period, any changes made to the diet in one management period will automatically be replicated for any other management periods using the same diet. Therefore, if the user needs to make different modifications to an existing diet for multiple animal groups/management periods, it is recommended that a copy be created for each management period, and then modified accordingly. Alternatively, the user can create an entirely new diet for each management period using the Custom Diet Creator.

	</em>
</p>
<br>

##### Digestate

The digestate tab allows the user to apply digestate that is produced by the anaerobic digestor component. In order to apply digestate, the user must have added an anaerobic digestor component to the farm and configured the digestor so that either animal manure and/or co-feedstocks are being added to the digestor. **If an anaerobic digestor component has not been added to the farm, the digestate tab will not be visible**.

Click here to see how an [Anaerobic Digestor Component](#anaerobic-digestion-component) can be added to the farm.

A field can have one or many applications of digestate. To add a digestate application to the selected field, click the **Add Digestate Application** button. Once an application has been added to the field, the user can adjust the details of the fied application.

- **Amount of digestate**: The amount of digestate must be specified by the user. This amount must consider the area of the field so that the total amount of digestate in all field applications does not exceed the total digestate produced by the digestor. The gauge labelled **Amount of digestate available** will indicate the remaining amount of digestate after all field applications have been considered. If an attempt is made to apply more digestate that is avaialable, a warning message will be shown to indicate this situation.

- **Liquid-solid separation**: When the anaerobic digestor has been configured to produce separated liquid and solid fractions, the option to select the digestate type will be available. If there is no liquid-solid separation, the only option available will raw digestate (not separated).


##### Soil

The soil tab allows the user to change the soil type for the specific field. The table shows the list of all soil types available for the selected polygon. If a soil type is to be set on the specific field, select one from the list. To customize the soil, click "Custom Mode" and edit the individual soil properties for the field only.

### Shelterbelt Component

- A **Shelterbelt component** consists of rows of trees where each row contains various tree types such as Caragana, Green Ash, Hybrid Polar etc. 

- **A shelterbelt row can contain more than one tree type and for each tree type, there are data fields that should be filled in.**

- In this section, we will navigate step by step into how we can modify the data for a shelterbelt component to suit your operation.

- **If you have not created a shelterbelt component**, please click here [Introducing Component Selection](#introducing-component-selection) to learn how to add a component to your farm.


#### Setting Up the Shelterbelt

After adding a shelterbelt component, you have various options to configure this component.

1.	Enter the “**Year of Observation**” for your shelterbelt.
2.	By default, there is one row of trees in the shelterbelt when the component is added to your farm. **To add an additional row of trees, click “Additional Row”.**

<p align="center">

		C: A Shelterbelt row: row length and row name
		<br>
		D: A Tree type in a shelterbelt row
	</em>
</p>
<br>


#### Modifying the Shelterbelt Rows

-	**Each row in a shelterbelt consists of various tree type(s)** where **each tree type will have its own data fields** that need to be filled in as **shown in Figure 6.3**. **This will be covered in the “Modifying Tree Type Data Section”.**
-	Each row has a data field for the **Row Name and the Row Length(m)** and are located above each row as **shown in Figure 6.3**. 
-	By default, the row name will always correspond to the specific tree types in your shelterbelt row, but you have the option to customize the row name to suit your operation. For example, in figure 6.3, the first row in our shelterbelt consists of a caragana and hybrid poplar tree, therefore the row name will be automatically be adjusted to be “Caragana, Hybrid Poplar”.
-	**If you would like to add another tree type to one of your shelterbelt rows**, beside each shelterbelt row is a button called “**Additional Tree Type**”. 



#### Modifying Tree Type Data in a Shelterbelt Row

For each tree type in your shelterbelt row(s), there is a set of data fields that need to be filled corresponding to the shelterbelts on your farm.
1.	**Select the tree type** by clicking on the drop-down menu beside the “**Species**” tab. You will be shown a list of available tree types, select one.
2.	**Input the rest of the data corresponding to your tree type** which includes: average spacing between trees(m), number of trees and the average circumference(cm) and the tree type name. 
3.	If you do not know the average circumference for your tree type, click on the “Calculator” button beside the “Average Circumference” field. For more information on the Average Circumference Calculator,follow instructions in the next section titled, Average Circumference Calculator.

### Crop Rotation Component

A crop rotation component is similar to a field component and allows the representation of multiple field components on the farm. For example, suppose a farm contains multiple field components that are added to represent the rotation of crops on a field over the years. In that case, a crop rotation component can represent the same information through a single entry. This allows for an easier and more manageable representation of fields and crops on the farm.


<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter6/figure6-58.png" alt="Figure6-58" width="850"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 6.58 - Crop Rotation Component
	</em>
</p>
<br>


The crop rotation component allows one to easily set the crop grown in a specific year and automatically sets the rotation based on the number of crops chosen.

<br>
<p align="center">

		B: Arrow buttons allow adjustment of the crops in the rotation.
		<br>
		C: The current rotation for each field.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

Most of the remaining settings in the crop rotation component are similar to the [field component mentioned earlier](#field-component).

An additional settings tab is present in the crop rotation component that is missing from the field component, i.e., 'Winter & Cover Crops'. This tab provides options to manage and change settings related to the cover crop for each field.

Adding a winter/cover/undersown crop to any specific crop will enable this tab for that particular crop.

## Animal Components

-	The animal components are separated into the following categories: **Beef Production, Dairy, Swine, Poultry, Sheep, and Other Livestock.**
-	All the results for each animal component will be displayed on a **single results page.** 
-	However, each animal component requires their own set of data inputs.
-	This section will go through how to enter data for each component category.

<br>

### Setting Up Animal Components

-	The animal component is very similar in terms of the structure and data required to create the components.
-	Each **animal component** consists of **one or more animal groups (e.g. heifers vs steers)**, where **each animal group has one or more management periods.**
- The **management period** is separated into categories and allows the user to enter data for **General, Diet, Housing and Manure** details for each **animal group.**

## Infrastructure Components

This category contains components related to the infrastructure of the farm.

### Anaerobic Digestion Component:

A single anaerobic digestor component may be added to the farm. The anaerobic digestor component has the following assumptions when used:
- The system is a wet anaerobic continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR)
- The primary feedstock is livestock manure with an optional co-feedstock of crop residues
- Biogas valorisation: heat, power, or direct injection to the gas grid
- Digestate treatment: solid-liquid separation

There are four steps that must be followed to configure the anaerobic digestor component.

1. In the first step, the user must choose to have all digestate produced by the system separated in to liquid and solid fractions, or, to have all digestate output in a raw (unseparated) form. By default, the anaerobic digestor will perform liquid and solid separation of digestate. 

2. In the second step, the user can configure the amounts of manure that are input as feedstock into the system. In order to add manure, there must be at least one animal component added to the farm. Once there is at least one animal component added to the farm, the user must then select which management periods will be used as the basis for manure feedstock into the system. By default, no management periods are selected. To select a management period, the user can click the checkbox under the **Add** column. Once a management period has been selected, 100% of the daily manure produced during that time period will be used as feedstock entering the digestor. The user can then modify this daily amount by adjusting the value under the **Daily proportion of manure added (%)** column.

3. An optional co-feedstock may be added in step three. This co-feedstock can be a crop residue, food waste, or sewage sludge. To add a co-feedstock, press the **Add Farm Residue Substrate Type** button. The user can then select the type of farm residue that will be used, the flow rate, and the start and end dates that indicate when substrate will beging being added to the digestor and when the substrate will stop being added to the digestor.

4. In step four, the user must select the target output of the digestor. The current options available are **electricity production**, **heat production**, or **methane injection to the gas grid**.

The user may choose to view additional information and adjust optional setting for the anaerobic digestor by clicking the **Yes** button beside the **Show Additional Information** option in the upper right corner of the screen.

At the top of the additional information section, Holos will display the amount of digestate remaining after all field applications have been considered. The amounts will be displayed in a gauge/dial to indicate that the digestate is being stored in a "tanks" that are used internally by Holos. The amounts shown in the gauges will show the total amount of digestate produced by the system minus any amounts applied to a field. If the user has selected to apply liquid and solid separation to the digestate then there will be two gauges displayed. If the user has chosen not to apply liquid solid separation, then only one gauge will be show. If the user has not made any field applications, no gauges will be shown here.

Click here to see [how to create a digestate field application](#digestate).

The section below the gauge display area is the total amounts of digestate produced by the system. These amounts do not consider any field applications of digestate.

The final section in the under the additional information are allows the user to adjust the number of reactors used by the anaerobic digestor and the hydraulic retention time. By default, Holos will use one reactor and a corresponding hydraulic retention time of 25 days. If the number of reactors is changed to 2 (maximum number of reactors allowed is 2), then Holos will change the hydraulic retention time to 60 days. The hydraulic retention time will be used to calculate the flow rate of degraded volatile solids during digestion.

# Chapter 7 - Timeline


To view the Timeline, your farm must be in **Advanced mode**.
- [Learn how to switch between Basic and Advanced modes by clicking here](#how-do-i-switch-between-advanced-and-simple-mode).

The timeline screen allows you to see your farm over a period from 1985 to present day. The timeline screen is used for the following components:

- Farm crop system timeline
- Shelterbelt timeline


## Farm crop system timeline:

The crop system timeline shows an overview of the crop(s) grown on the farm and allows the user to add historical and future projections to a particular field and its crop systems.

-	To **add a historical or projected production system** click on the field in the list of production systems under “**Step 1**” or by selecting the system in the timeline region.  
-	Once clicked the system is now active, click either “**Add Historical Production System**” or “**Add Projected Production System**”.
-	Adding a **historical production system** will create a new inline block with the original field at the **beginning of the timeline** while a **projected production system** places the new block at the **end of timeline.**

## Shelterbelt Timeline

The shelterbelt timeline works similarly to the farm crop timeline. The timeline shows the type of tree, the year it was planted and the cut-off year. The numbers at the top of the timeline signify the year.  In the shelterbelt timeline, you can adjust the following:

- The year the tree was planted.
- The cut-off year of the timeline.
- The year of observation.
- Number of trees alive today (from drop down named 'Mortality').

# Chapter 8 - Details

## Overview

-	To view this screen, ensure that you are in **Advanced Mode**.
-	This screen offers a detailed grid related to your farm’s fields like **carbon input**, **yield**, and **other factors** for each year of your production systems you created in the **timeline**.  
-	If you don’t know how to create a production system you can learn how by reading Timeline: Setup a Production System
-	We are first introduced to the “**data tray**” (see figure 8.1) on the left of the cropping system grid.  
	-	Clicking on “**Enable Columns**” to the left side of the data grid expands a tray of the available data columns.  
	-	Clicking “Enable Columns” again will collapse the tray to the side.
	-	 The tray allows you to show or hide different columns in the grid.  Your choice of what columns to hide will persist across sessions and farms (i.e. data columns hidden in one farm will also be hidden in other new and existing farms). 
	-	 The data is available in other views using the exact same functionality across each instance.
-	If you have come to this screen and then gone back to change something about your fields then you may have to reload the data to keep it up to date with your changes.  To accomplish the reload click “**Reload Data From Previous Screen**” in the upper left corner of the view.   
-	You can change how the screen reports the yields of your fields with the drop-down menu beside “**Yield Assignment Method**” **(default is “Average Yield”).**
-	Like other grids in Holos you can sort and filter each column shown.  Anything to the right of the Yield column can be edited by hand.

-	To assign load a file with custom yields in the results view of Holos, select the drop-down menu beside “**Yield Assignment Method**” and choose “**Input file**”.
-	Click on the button that appears, labeled “**Load Custom Yield Data**”.
-	You will be shown a file explorer. Navigate to your input file.
-	The input file must be a **Comma Separated Value (CSV)** file.
-	The format of the file should be as follows:
	-	A column for the year, and as many fields as you have.
	-	You can have as many years and farm names as you like in the file if they conform to the above format.
	- Note that you must separate the field name and farm name by a hyphen for Holos to correctly associate the yield value with the appropriate field and farm.

# Chapter 10 - Command Line Interface

## What is a Command Line Interface

-	The Holos Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to efficiently process large amounts of data corresponding to the various operations on your Farm.
-	The interface requires the user to **create data input Excel files** for multiple farms and their respective components (i.e. fields, cow-calf, swine, etc.).
-	Excel files for data input should be saved using CSV format. **Microsoft Excel is recommended** since other third-party software (such as OpenOffice) is known to cause input errors.
-	Input files cannot be open in another program while the CLI is running. 
-	In this section, we will go through instructions on how to **set up the CLI**, how to **modify settings files**, how to **create data files for each Component and how to use the CLI.**

<br>
<br>

## Setting up the Command Line Interface
In this section, we will go through the steps to properly set up the CLI regarding: navigating the Holos directory, modifying the global settings files, creating/modifying data input Excel files and adding a new farm folder to the CLI,  for each of the Components in your farm.

### The CLI Farms Folder

- The Holos Command Line Interface requires the user to create a "Farms" folder where all farm related data will be stored.
- This Farms folder in a general folder that contains all individual farms that the user wants to work with.
- Each individual farm folder then contains different folders for each of the components in your farm as well as a global settings file for that farm (where you can set your global defaults for each farm). 
- Additionally, each component folder contains Excel files that store the data inputs for each of your operations (i.e., data input files for a field or a cow-calf component in your farm).

<br>

#### Creating a New Farms Folder

1. When you start Holos CLI, you will be prompted to enter the location of your "Farms" folder. This "Farms" folder can be located anywhere on your PC. After you specify your general Farms folder, Holos will create a default farm folder inside this general folder called called “HolosExampleFarm”.

	This default folder will contain multiple other folders for each of Holo's Components as well as a '**Farm.Settings**' file containing all settings related to this specific farm.

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-1.png" alt="Figure10-1" width="750"/>
    <br>
    <em>

	</em>
</p>
<br>

    <br>
    <em>

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-3 - Default component folders created by CLI.
	</em>
</p>
<br>


You will then be prompted to import any farms from the Holos GUI version. Subsequent options will prompt you regarding further settings related to your Farms.

2. To create a proper template farm folder, Holos needs to know the units of measurement you would prefer. Please select Metric or Imperial when prompted.

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-4.png" alt="Figure10-4" width="750"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-4 - Prompt the select the Units of Measurement.
	</em>
</p>
<br>


3. The default template farm folder will be created in your specified directory. Press “enter” to allow the program to exit so you can create data input files for your farm(s). Navigate to the location to see your new farm folder.

	This default template Farm folder will contain all the necessary component directories, a settings file and template data files for each component for you to use to create your own farms

<br>

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-5 - Prompt after the default farm folder is created.
	</em>
</p>
<br>
	

Please note that if you have previously used the Holos CLI, after opening the CLI again you will be prompted to enter the location of the previously used "Farms" folder or select a new "Farms folder"

<br>

	</em>
</p>
<br>


#### Add a New Farm to Existing Farms Folder:
How do I add a new farm to my current farms CLI folder
There are two methods to add a new farm to an existing farms folder. [The common questions section covers both methods.](#how-do-i-add-a-new-farm-to-my-current-farms-cli-folder)


#### Navigating through the Farms Folder:

1. By default, Holos will create an example farm folder in the Holos CLI “Farms” directory as shown below

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-2.png" alt="Figure10-2" width="650"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Default farm folder created by CLI
	</em>
</p>
<br>

2.	This example farm folder will automatically contain a list of folders corresponding to all the components that are available for use in Holos (i.e., fields, cow-calf etc.). As well as a settings file for that specific farm folder

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-3.png" alt="Figure10-3" width="650"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Default component folders created by CLI
	</em>
</p>
<br>

3.	Each of these component folders will all have a template data input Excel file that you can use as a reference to create additional data input files. Each data input Excel file represents one of that components whose folder we have chosen. 

	For example, if we are in the shelterbelts folder, each data input Excel file will represent one shelterbelt in your farm. So, if you have two shelterbelts in your farm, you will have two of these data input files.

<br>

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-6 - A template file representing a single component.
	</em>
</p>
<br>


### Modifying Settings Files

-	Each of your Farm Folders will have a settings file that will allow you to set the specific defaults such as Global Settings, Farm Defaults, Temperature, Precipitation, Evapotranspiration, Soil and Crop Defaults for that specific farm

1. Navigate to the farm folder whose default settings file you wish to modify.
2. In the selected farm folder, will be a file called “farm.settings”, open this file.
3. In the settings file, you can modify the default values for settings that are relevant to the operations in your farm such as:  Global Settings, Precipitation, Temperature, Evapotranspiration and Soil Defaults.
4. This settings file can be opened using any text editor e.g. Notepad.

<br>

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-7 - Farm global settings file.
	</em>
</p>
<br>


### Modifying Component Data Input Excel Files

-	As mentioned above, each farm folder contains a list of folders that correspond to the available components that are available for use in Holos. Each of these component folders contains a template data input Excel file that you can **modify to suit the operations for each component in your farm.**
-	In this section, we will go through the guidelines for populating the data inputs for each of the component’s data input Excel files. **Each data input file should represent one of your components**. For example, if you have multiple shelterbelts on your farm, you will create a different data input Excel file **for each shelterbelt**.

<br>

#### Land Management Components

<br>

#### Shelterbelt Data Input Excel Files

-	**Row**: refers to the row in the Excel file
-	**Shelterbelt** row: refers to the row of trees in a shelterbelt
-	**Each row in the Shelterbelt data input Excel file can be split into three groups:**
	-	**Shelterbelt Data**: Hardiness Zone, Ecodistrict ID, Shelterbelt Name, Year of Observation
	-	**Shelterbelt Row Data**: Row Name, Row Length, Row ID, Plant Year, Cut Year
	-	**Tree Group Data**: Species, Planted Tree Count, Planted Tree Spacing(m), Live Tree Count, DBH 
-	If your shelterbelt row consists of more than one tree type, you would create an Excel data row that corresponds to each tree type that is a part of that shelterbelt row.

<br>

		<br>
		B: Shelterbelt Row Data.
		<br>
		C: Tree Group Data.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

-	Below, we can see that both of the highlighted Excel rows are referring to the same shelterbelt row, the only difference is that **one Excel row refers to the tree type,** **caragana**, while the **other row refers to the tree type, green ash**. These two Excel rows together, represent the data for the shelterbelt row, “**Caragana, Green Ash**” which consists of the two tree groups where **each tree group has its own set of data, but they belong to the same row.**

	</em>
</p>
<br>

- For every single row of trees in a shelterbelt, please set a unique row ID

-	For multi-row shelterbelts, each row of trees will need a unique row ID please follow the same procedure as shown above to populate the rest of the Excel data input file. 
-	However, there are some inputs that accept different data values such as the “Hardiness Zone” and “Species”. 


<br>

##### Special Data Input Values
-	**Hardiness Zone**:  Naming convention follows “H(0-9)(a-b)”. For example, a valid hardiness zone would be “H3a” or “H3b” or “H9a”, where the first letter will always be “H” and for the subsequent number/letter, you can choose a range between 0-9 and either a or b to represent the appropriate hardiness zone for your farm.
-	**Species**: Caragana, Green Ash, Hybrid Poplar, Manitoba Maple, Scots Pine, White Spruce, Average Deciduous, Average Conifer.

<br>

-	**Each Excel row represents the data associated with ONE crop** (Crop, Manure, Cover Crop Data, etc.) and the Crop Row/Field the Crop the Crop belongs to (Crop Row\Field Data).

<br>

##### Perennial Crop

-	If the crop is **perennial, there are three important data fields that need to be filled properly**: Crop Year, Perennial Stand ID, and Perennial Stand Length (Years). 
-	Perennial stand ID takes on the form of 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000, where the zero’s can be any character you wish.  A simple stand ID might be 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001.
-	**To create a perennial stand length**, please create the appropriate row(s) for each year but **change the Crop Year and Year in Perennial Stand accordingly and refer to the appropriate Perennial Crop via the Perennial Stand ID**. (i.e. if we are referring to PerennialCrop1, and it has a Perennial Stand Length of four years, we will have four Excel rows that refer to the Perennial Stand ID of 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 but with different values for the Crop Year (2017, 2018, 2019 & 2020) and Year In Perennial Stand (1, 2, 3, 4)  and varying data values for the Crop’s Data. 
-	This is so that we can accurately group together the **perennial crop(s)** data for each year. 
-	**For each different type of perennial crop, please assign a unique perennial stand ID**. E.g. If the perennial stand was a mixed hay of smooth brome grass & alfalfa; smooth brome would have a unique perennial stand ID and alfalfa would have a unique perennial stand ID.
-	Therefore, for each of the perennial crops in your field, please follow the same procedure as shown above to populate the rest of the field Excel data input file. 
-	Look at Figures 10.10 - 10.14 for examples of Perennial Crop Data (Hay Grass).

<br>

##### Annual Crop

-	**If the crop is not a perennial crop**, please set the values for the Perennial Stand headers above to “N/A” and the stand ID to 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Populate the rest of the data columns appropriately for that crop.
-	Therefore, for each of the annual crops in your field, please follow the same procedure as shown above to populate the rest of the Field Excel data input file. 
-	Look at Figures 10.10 - 10.14 for examples of Non-Perennial Crop Data (Barley).

<br>

#### Animal Components

-	The animal components consist of **Swine, Beef, Dairy, Sheep, Poultry and Other Livestock** groups.
-	Animal components all **consist of different animal groups** 
-	Each animal group has its own management period(s) that consists of data for the **Diet, Housing and Manure** details **for one management period.**
-	**You can have multiple management periods for an animal group.** 
-	**If you have multiple management periods for an animal group**, please add another row referring to the same animal group (**same group name and group type**) but change the management period data accordingly.
-	**You cannot have two different animal types that belong to the same group**. For example: if you are looking at a swine component and you have one group called “SwineStartersGroup1”. This group cannot refer to more than one animal type (i.e. only Swine Starters, or Swine Finishers or Growers) – you can call the group anything you want, **an animal group cannot refer to more than one animal type.**
-	Some **animal components** will have some extra data that are specific to their animal type such as **Milk Production** for dairy animals or **Wool Production** for sheep.
-	In this section, we will go over the different types of animal components and their data files. 
-	**Below** is an example of the categories you will see in an animal component data file.
-	The headers **Housing Type** and **Manure Management** are only shown below as an example to make it easier to categorize. They will **NOT** be present in your data input files.

## Using the Command Line Interface

-	If you have not set up your folders and data input files for the components in your farm(s), please click here: [How to Set Up the Command Line Interface](#setting-up-the-command-line-interface)
-	If you do not know how to modify your settings file for your farm please click here: [How to Modify the Settings Files for a Farm](#modifying-settings-files)
-	Please look at the CLI Checklist here: [Holos Command Line Interface Checklist](#check-list-for-command-line-interface)
-	Otherwise, the files corresponding to your farm(s) are ready to be processed and this section will guide you on how to run the Command Line Interface.

<br>

1.	In your settings file for each farm, adjust the settings to suit your operations. If you do not know what a settings file is, please click here: [Modifying Settings Files](#modifying-settings-files).

2.	The first time you start the Command Line Interface, you will be prompted to enter the location of your “Farms” folder (this can be any folder that you create on your computer). 

	The subsequent times you start the Holos Command Line Interface, you will be asked if you would like to use your previously entered location or to enter a new location. 

	Refer to [Creating a New Farms Folder](#creating-a-new-farms-folder) for help creating an initial farms folder and learning about subsequent prompts.

3. You will be asked if you have farms that you would like to import from the Holos GUI (yes/no).
If you select "yes", you will be prompted to enter the full directory path of your exported farm(s). 

	It is advised that you save/move the .json file of the farm you have exported from the GUI to the same location of your "Farms" folder. This is because the imported .json will be converted to a folder containing .csv files corresponding to farm components for the Command Line Interface to process.

4. You will be prompted to select a unit of measurement for the program to run in (Metric = 1, Imperial = 2). Please select an option.

5. The Command Line Interface will now process each of the farms that you have created and their corresponding component data input files.

	When the processing and parsing is finished, you will see a "Conversion Finished" message in the CLI.
	
6. The results for your farm(s) will be exported to the base directory of your “Farms” directory in an “Outputs” folder to be in Step 1.

</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>

## Command Line Arguments and Input Flags

There are a number of useful command line arguments available for the the Holos CLI. 

__The first argument must be the full directory path to your farms folder.__

Following this directory path, and in any order, the following command flags can be used:
- -i : your input .json file. This is case sensitive and requires the file extension.
- -f : a folder of .json files for importing multiple farms. This is case sensitive. 
- -s : a configured .settings file within the farms folder. This input flag is only available if the -i and/or -f flag is also used. This is also case sensitive and requires the file extension.
- -u : your chosen unit of measurement, "metric" or "imperial". This is not case sensitive.
- -p : SLC polygon ID to process the given input farm with climate and geographical data derived from a polygon ID. This will not alter the .json file.
- -o : output directory path for outputs.

Input .json files, input folders, and .SETTINGS files must be in the given farms folder.

If you have built the solution from source code, the CLI executable will be found with the ..\H\H.CLI\bin\Debug folder of your local repository. 

If you have [installed the CLI](https://github.com/holos-aafc/Holos#download), there are extra steps required to utilize the command line arguments and input flags. Instructions can be found in [Chapter 11.](#using-command-line-arguments-and-input-flags-after-installing-the-holos-cli)

## Command Line Interface Results

-	The Command Line Interface will output the **results for each farm** you have created and their respective components as well as the **total results for all the farms combined.**
-	The results will be displayed in an Excel file and correspond to the following categories: **Carbon Dioxide Equivalence Emissions, Green House Gas Emissions, Estimates of Production and Feed Estimates.**
-	**Carbon Dioxide Equivalence Emissions** are in units of **Megagrams (Mg)** and **Green House Gas Emissions** are in units of **kilograms (kg).**
-	**If you have multiple settings files for a farm**, there will be results files for each settings file in that farm.
-	You can find these results in the “**Outputs**” folder of the Holos Command Line Interface base directory.
-	**If you are looking for more specific results for each farm, please go to the appropriate farm output folder.**

<br>

### Total Results (Yearly Basis)

-	The **Total Results (All Farms)** will calculate the appropriate estimates for every farm and their respective components and animal groups and will display them in an Excel file. You will be able to see the totals for each farm and the totals for all the farms combined on a **yearly basis.** 
-	**Each component** in a farm **is categorized** in the following: **Beef Production, Dairy, Other livestock, Poultry, Sheep, and Swine.**
-	**If the data is not applicable**, the data field will show “N/A”
-	**Each component category** consists of **components**, where each component consists of **animal groups.** 
-	The results for each of these component categories and their respective components will be calculated and displayed for each farm.
-	These results will be in the “**Outputs**” folder located in the base directory of your “**Farms**” folder in the “**TotalResultsForAllFarms**” folder

### Carbon Dioxide Equivalence Emissions

-	Holos will calculate the carbon dioxide equivalence emissions for each Farm and their respective components.
-	The results will include the following calculated emission values: **Enteric CH4, Manure Ch4, Direct Nitrous Oxide, Indirect Nitrous Oxide, Energy Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Dioxide emissions.**
-	**Energy carbon dioxide** is calculated for **each animal group** (i.e. backgrounder steers), **therefore**, you will see “**N/A**” for the data fields that are not applicable.

<br>

### Green House Gas Emissions

-	Holos will calculate the green house gas emissions for each farm and their respective components.
-	The results will include the following calculated emission values: **Enteric CH4, Manure CH4, Direct Nitrous Oxide, Indirect Nitrous Oxide, Energy Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Dioxide emissions.** 
-	**Energy carbon dioxide** is calculated for **each animal group** (i.e. backgrounder steers), **therefore**, you will see “N/A” for the data fields that are not applicable.
-	**However, these are not converted to carbon dioxide equivalence values**

<br>

### Estimates of Production

-	Holos will calculate the estimates of production for each farm and their respective components.
-	The results will include the following calculated estimates of production values: **Harvest, Area, Manure Available for Land Application, Beef Produced, Lamb Produced, Milk Produced and Fat Protein Corrected Milk Production.**

<br>

### Feed Estimates

-	Holos will calculate the estimates of production for each farm and their respective components.
-	The results will include the following calculated feed estimate value: **Dry Matter Intake.**

<br>

### Specific Component Results for a Farm

-	In each farm output folder, there will be directories corresponding to each available land management component category in Holos. 
-	For each land management component, there will be a specific output results file for each land management component data file you have made. **These results are specific to the component you are interested in** and we will go over each in this section.

<br>

#### Shelterbelt Component Results
-	The shelterbelt results will provide carbon emission details for every row and their corresponding species ranging from the **start year** until the **cut year.**

<br>

#### Field Component Results
-	The field results will display results based on the **Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM)** which will show all the carbon and nitrogen emission information related to your crops from 1985 to present day.

## Check List for Command Line Interface

-	The Command Line Interface requires the data inputs to be properly formatted and the appropriate components to be created for the data to be able to be processed. 
-	This section is a guideline for you to make sure that you do not encounter any errors when setting up the Command Line Interface.
-	 If you do encounter errors please click here: [Error Guide For The Command Line Interface](#error-guide-for-the-command-line-interface)

<br>

### Properly Filled Data Files
-	Fill according to the guidelines in the section: [How To Modify Component Data Input Excel Files](#modifying-component-data-input-excel-files)
-	**Remember that each file is a representation of one of the components in your farm**. For example, if you have two shelterbelts that you would like to represent as data input Excel files, you will need to create two data input Excel files, one for each shelterbelt and make sure their names are unique.
-	**Do not modify or remove the headers** of any of the data input Excel files or the Command Line Interface will stop processing.
-	**Fill in the data corresponding to the guidelines for each component**, there are **special headers that require specific data inputs** that you can choose from in each guideline. Make sure you spell your data inputs correctly!
-	**If you encounter one of these errors**, please navigate to the appropriate component guide under: [Modifying Component Data Input Files](#modifying-component-data-input-excel-files). Each of the sections will have a guide for the special data fields, indicating what data inputs are valid for that field.
-	**Do not input negative values where they do not make sense**. For example, if you set the “Year of Observation” to be “-1996”, the Command Line Interface will stop processing
-	**Do not leave data fields empty,** the command line interface will stop processing if there is no data.
-	**For some data fields, if the header is not applicable,  set the data input to be “N/A”**, for example in a field component, if you have an annual crop and you come across the headers “**Perennial Stand ID**”, “**Perennial Stand Length**” and “**Year in Perennial Stand**”, please set those fields to be “**N/A**”


<br>

### Unique Names for Components

For example, in the shelterbelts directory, if you have two Excel files: Shelterbelt1.csv and Shelterbelt2.csv and they both hold data for the component “ExampleShelterbelt1”, the Holos Command Line Interface will not process the data because their names are not unique.

<br>

### Valid References to Other Components

The user must ensure that the references to other components are valid and the component is actually a data file.

-	Make sure that if one of your component’s requires a reference to another component you have made, that the component you are referencing has the proper data input Excel file created in the appropriate farm and component folder and that you reference the component’s name (**NOT THE FILE NAME**) if you are required to refer to it in one of your data input fields for another component.
-	**For example**, in a **swine** component, you have selected the **Housing Type** to be “Pasture” and the pasture you would like to refer to is a custom field that reflects your farming operation. **Please make sure to create a data input Excel file with the data that reflects your custom field in the chosen farm’s fields folder** and make sure that the component name data field for each data input file is unique(**you cannot have components with the same name**).
-	Therefore, if the custom field component you have created has its **field name** set to “**FieldNameExample1**”, then whenever you would like to refer to that specific field in any component that can have a reference to a field, you would set the data field to be “FieldNameExample1”. 
-	As a result, for the pasture data field of the swine component, you would set the data input field to be “FieldNameExample1” if you would like to refer to that custom field.

<br>

### CLI Generated Component Directory Names are not Changed

The user must ensure that they do not change the names of the component directories in each farm.

If the names of the component’s are not valid, the data will not be processed. You will be shown a message that will tell you which component directory is invalid.

<br>
<br>

## Error Guide for the Command Line Interface

-	This section will focus on the possible errors that can occur when you are creating your data input Excel files for each component.
-	The error message will always be displayed on the Command Line Interface and will tell you the row, column, and file where the error has occurred.
-	**If the Command Line Interface encounters any of the errors below, it will stop execution of the program until the issue is fixed.**

<br>

### General Data Input Errors

### One of the Data Values is Empty

1. Below is an example of an empty data value in a Beef Finisher data input Excel file

</p>
<br>


### A Header Has Been Modified (Misspelled, Empty, Special Characters)

Please do not modify the headers in any of the component data input Excel files.

1. Below is an example of a header that has been modified – meaning it is empty or has been misspelled

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-42.png" alt="Figure10-42" width="950"/>
    <br>
    <em>

		<br>
		A: Invalid header value.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

### Unique Fields That Have Special Data Input Values

-	These errors are special because they **require specific data input values** and are **different for each component** (i.e. A shelterbelt component will have different fields than a field component, therefore the errors you may encounter will be different).
-	**If you encounter one of these errors**, please navigate to the appropriate component guide under: [Modifying Component Data Input Files](#modifying-component-data-input-excel-files). Each of the sections will have a guide for the special data fields, indicating what data inputs are valid for that field.

<br>

1. Below is an example of a special data field in the shelterbelt data input file that has been incorrectly entered. A “Hardiness Zone” can take a data value in the following format: “H(0-9)(a-b)”. Meaning the data values should always be preceded by an “H” and the subsequent numbers/letter can be any value within the specified range (0-9 or a-b).

<br>

# Chapter 11 Appendix - Additional Information, Common Questions & Troubleshooting


### Holos Backup System

Holos contains a backup system that automatically creates backups of user data in a folder alongside the saved user data files. This folder is located inside the Holos data folder. To read instructions on how to access the [Holos data folder, click here](#how-to-find-the-holos-program-data-files).

Inside the Holos data folder, you will find another folder called **backups**. This backups folder contains up to **5** backups of your data at any time.

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter11/figure11-21.png" alt="" width="750"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 11-21 - The holos data folder that contains the backup files
	</em>
</p>
<br>



There are some important things to note regarding the backup files created by Holos:

1. Holos creates a backup of your data every time the application is started.

2. A backup is only created when Holos successfully loads data.

3. A maximum of **5** user data backups are maintained and are created on a rolling basis. This means that if there are five backups already created, instead of creating a sixth one, Holos deletes the oldest backup in the backup folder and replaces it with a new backup.

	3.1. If you would like to maintain or save a particular backup, it is strongly recommended to **keep that backup file in a separate location on your computer**.

4. Backup files are named/created in the following format: `holos-backup-{date}-{time}.json`. For example `holos-backup-2022-09-29_04_17_02_PM.json`. Therefore, all backup files contain the date and time that the backup was created..


<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter11/figure11-22.png" alt="" width="750"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 11-22 - Up to five backups are stored inside the backups folder.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

<br>


#### Restoring backups in case of data corruption

In situations where saved data cannot be loaded due to data corruption or an improper save during the previous program session, if available, Holos tries to load backup data automatically. Holos loads the most recently created backup file if multiple backups are available. **A message is displayed after the first loading page when a backup file is restored**. This message contains information regarding which backup was restored:


<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter11/figure11-23.png" alt="" width="750"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 11-23 - A message during startup indicating that a data backup was restored.
	</em>
</p>
<br>


If you want to manually restore one of the five backups in the backup folder, please delete the **json-data.json** file in the **HOLOS_4** folder and replace it with your chosen backup. Please remember to change the name of the backup file to **json-data**; otherwise, holos will not be able to read this data file.

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter11/figure11-24.gif" alt="" width="750"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 11-24 - Manually restoring a backup data file.
	</em>
</p>
<br>


#### Data crash file

As mentioned previously, Holos automatically tries to load one of the available backups in the backup folder if the original data file cannot be loaded. In a situation where none of the backup files can be loaded or if no backups are available, Holos will start a new program session. In these situations, Holos will also create a crash file containing the data the program could not read.

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter11/figure11-25.png" alt="" width="650"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 11-25 - A crash file is created when data cannot be loaded.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

If you don't have any backups available to restore previous data, this crash file can be sent to the Holos developers to help restore data and troubleshoot problems with the program. To learn how to submit this file, read the[ how to report an error message section.](#how-to-report-an-error-message-and-create-a-bug-report)

<br>
<br>


### How to find the Holos Program data file(s).

The Holos program data files contain useful information that can help the Holos developers troubleshoot program crashes and other issues you might notice in the program. The Holos data files are unique to each system running the Holos software and are based on your usage of the program. You can find these files by following these steps:


- On your windows computer, **press the start button**. The start button is the icon on the bottom left corner of your screen (on the taskbar) that looks like a windows icon; after pressing this button type **run** and press **enter**.

<br>
<p align="center">

	</em>
</p>
<br>


- After pressing enter, another window will now appear on your screen. This window will show you the contents of the Holos user data folder on your PC. 


- Inside the HOLOS_4 folder, you will find files related to the configuration and settings of the Holos program. For example, one of these files is named **json-data**. This file is the Holos project data file and includes data and information regarding your farms and settings. Depending on how you use Holos, there might be multiple files in this folder in addition to **json-data**.

<br>

</p>
<br>



-	If you are trying to troubleshoot Holos, please create a new issue in Holos' GitHub repository. The [how to report an error message section](#how-to-report-an-error-message-and-create-a-bug-report) explains the process of submitting an error report. 

- To help troubleshoot issues please add all data/crash files to a zip archive and attach that .zip file to the issue created on GitHub. Please see the following section on [how to create a .zip archive](#how-to-create-a-zip-archive-file).


<br>
<br>

### Holos log file(s).

The Holos program log files contain information regarding the Holos application and its internal processes. The log files track the state of the Holos application since it is started by the user until the point the application is closed or forcefully shut down. Please note a few important points regarding the log files:

- The content of the log files can be easily read using any text editor e.g. Notepad.
- The log files only contain information regarding Holos and its internal processes. The files do not track any information regarding any other process or part of the user system.
- The log files are never sent outside of the user system and are always strictly kept offline. They can only leave the user's system if the user explicitly transfers the file themselves.
- Holos maintains one log file per day and rolls over to a new file up to a maximum of 7 files. On the 8th day, the oldest log file is automatically deleted.

The purpose of the log files is to help users troubleshoot issues regarding Holos and its operation in situations where the application isn't performing within expectations.

<br>

### How to find the Holos log file(s)

The Holos log files are located next to the Holos data and backup files inside a folder called `logfiles`. On windows based systems this folder is located in the `APPDATA` folder. To read instructions on how to access the [Holos data folder, click here](#how-to-find-the-holos-program-data-files).

Inside the Holos data folder, you can locate the subfolder called  `logfiles` that contains the logs for the program

<br>
<p align="center">

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 11-31 - Holos data folder containing a subfolder called logfiles.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

Opening the folder will show the currently stored log files for Holos. Log files are named in the format `<holos-logs><data-log-created>.log` e.g. holos-logs-2024-01-29.log.

<br>

3.	After the process is finished, a new file will be created in the same folder (HOLOS_4). Windows will then allow you to rename this zipped file. Change the name of this file to **holos-data-files**. You can send this compressed/zipped file to the holos developers by [creating a new issue on the GitHub repository](#how-to-report-an-error-message-and-create-a-bug-report). This zipped archive file will contain all the files you selected in step 1.

	</em>
</p>
<br>

2.	After selecting all the files. Right click using your mouse’s right button on any of the highlighted files to open a new menu. In this new menu, go to **Send to** and select “**Compressed (zipped) folder**”. Selecting this will create a single new .zip file containing all the files you selected/highlighted in **Step 1.**

### Holos Error Messages

Error messages can appear when Holos encounters an internal error and is unable to resolve the issue. When Holos encounters an internal error, it displays a message in the program informing the user that an error has occurred. Below is an example of a similar error.

<br>
<p align="center">

	</em>
</p>
<br>

The message that Holos displays includes information about what the error was and how to report this error to the Holos developers. The next section describes the process of reporting this error to the Holos team.



### How to report an error message and create a bug report.

Reporting an error message to the Holos developers can allow them to troubleshoot the issue and help resolve any possible conflicts. 

When an internal error occurs, the software displays an error message (see Figure 11-16). To report this error (and other issues) to the developers, follow these steps:

**Note:**	If you get an error, as shown in the image below, click the button that says **Copy to Clipboard**. This will copy the error message and other relevant information to your computer’s clipboard. In addition, clicking this button allows you to paste this information into a different program or to include it in your communication with the Holos developers.

*Please note that clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button doesn't submit any information to the Holos developers.Instead, it simply copies information to your computer's clipboard.*

### Finding the Holos Software version number

The version number of your current Holos installation is displayed when you first launch the program. After starting the program, look for the version number in the small window that pops up where you're able to select your language.

### How do I add a new farm to my current farm's CLI folder:


##### Method 1: Copying an existing empty farm folder.

1. In your current 'Farms" folder, create a new folder for your new farm with an appropriate name.
2. Copy all files from an existing farm and paste them into this new folder that you have just created.
3. Modify the data input files as needed.

##### Method 2: Running the CLI again.

1. Start the Holos CLI.
2. You will be prompted to use the previously used Farms folder. Select **yes**.
3. Select the appropriate units of measurement in the next prompt.

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 11-4 - Using the Holos CLI to create a new farms folder.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

### Template Files

The Holos CLI will [generate template input files](#navigating-through-the-farms-folder) (.csv) for the user to manually enter farm data for processing. You can identify these generated template files by their filename, which will end with "_Example-en-CA.csv" or "_Example-fr-CA.csv". These file will be contain headers for user entered data, but will otherwise be empty. 

If the Holos CLI finds unmodified template files, it will display a message stating: "The following file does not have any data to parse:" followed by the full directory path to the file. These files will not affect your results, and may be deleted by the user. 

Note that template files will be generated when importing a farm from the Holos GUI. These template files may be deleted by the user as well.

### Duplicate Farm Folders for Farms Exported from the GUI

Each time the CLI is ran, Holos will ask if you have farms to import from the GUI. 

If you answer "yes" to this prompt, the CLI will find any .json file within the current farms directory and convert and process it's data, regardless if this procedure has taken place before. 

This may result in duplicate folders for farms exported from the Holos GUI. 

To prevent duplicating folders for farms, answer "Yes" only once to the prompt, and "No" each subsequent time running the CLI.

### Using command line arguments and input flags after installing the Holos CLI

If you have downloaded and installed the CLI link provided in the README, an application reference icon should appear on your desktop. 

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter11/Figure 11-28.png" alt="Figure 11-28" width="450"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 11-28 - Holos 4 CLI.appref-ms icon
	</em>
</p>
<br>

This icon is not itself an executable, and therefore cannot accept command line arguments. To find the exectuable associated with this icon: 
1. Run the Holos CLI by double-clicking on the application reference icon.
2. Open your Windows Task Manager.
3. Right-click the H.CLI app.
4. Left-click 'Open file location'.

<br>

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 11-29 - Finding H.Cli executable via Task Manager
	</em>
</p>
<br>

Now that you have exposed the file location of the H.CLI, you can create a shortcut, and move the shortcut to a more accessible place within your PC. 

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter11/Figure 11-30.png" alt="Figure 11-30" width="500" height ="400"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 11-30 - Create a shortcut of the H.CLI executable 
    </em>
</p>
<br>

This shortcut will have a .lnk file extension. Here is an example of how to use the shortcut within your command prompt using input flags:

_H.CLI.lnk file_path -i farm.json -u metric -p 793011 -o file_path_out_
