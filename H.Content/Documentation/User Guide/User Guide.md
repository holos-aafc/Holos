# Chapter 2 -  Starting Holos

Holos operates in one of two modes called “Basic” and “Advanced”.  As their names imply, they tailor the Holos experience for different needs.  If you do not need all the functionality that Holos offers and would rather get a summary of your farm’s emissions, then it is recommended to use the “Basic” mode.  If you want to get the most out of Holos with detailed results, then the “Advanced” mode is for you. 

Holos can handle multiple farms created by the user, each representing different farming scenarios for example.  The user can experiment with what management practices do well together or determine what crops to grow together based on their potential yield and green-house emissions. 

<br>

## Creating a new farm

1. On every Holos start-up you either create a new farm or open an existing farm or import a farm from file.  Figure  2.1 displays the interface you are greeted with on every start-up. Your initial start-up of Holos after installation will skip this screen and send you to step two, automatically selecting “New” for you, to begin the creation process. 

<br>
<p align="center">

    <br>
		<em>
			Figure 2-1: Create a new farm or open an existing farm selection screen or import from a file.
			<br>

		</em>
</p>
<br>


2. Please enter a name for the farm you would like to create in the “Name” section and add any additional comments in the “Comments” section. Once you have named your farm you must specify what mode you would like to operate Holos under, either “Basic” or “Advanced” mode.  When you are finished, click the “OK” button to proceed.

<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter2/figure2-2.png" alt="Figure 2-2" width="650"/>
    <br>
    <em> Figure 2.2 Entering name, comments, and selecting operating mode.</em>
</p>


3. If you chose “Advanced Mode” you can choose “Metric” or “Imperial” from the drop-down list (“Basic Mode” will skip this step and set your units to “Metric” for you). After you have chosen your unit of measurement, click the “Next” button on the bottom of the screen to proceed (figure 2.3).

<p align="center">

    <br>
    <em>Figure: 2.3 Unit of Measurement Selection Screen. 
	<br>
	A: Please select a unit of measurement using the drop-down menu.</em>
</p>

4. Select your province from the drop-down list and click “Next” on the bottom of the screen.

			<br>
			 B: Click here once you have selected your Province.
		</em>
</p>
<br>

## Selecting farm location

1. On your screen, you will now see many regions for the province you selected. Each specific region is shaded in red.  You can adjust the magnification (i.e. zoom in/out) of the map by using your mouse wheel or by selecting the magnifying glass near the bottom of the screen. Please select the location of your farm by right-clicking on one of the regions (see figure 2.5). 

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter2/figure2-5.png" alt="Figure 2-5" width="650"/>
    <br>
    <em>Figure: 2.5 Hovering the mouse cursor over the regions on the map will display a tool tip near you mouse pointer.</em>
</p>
<br>

2. When you have successfully clicked on one of the regions, Holos will download the climate data directly from NASA.  A progress bar will display the progress in downloading the data, it should only take a few seconds.   The details of that region will be displayed on the right side of the screen (Only for “Advanced Mode” see figure 2.6). You will see the location details, soil and hardiness zones, and climate details for the location you have selected. 

<br>

		<br>
		D: The details of the soil zones, hardiness zones and climate details for your chosen location will be shown here.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

3. If the region you have selected has multiple soil types, please select the appropriate option for your farm based on either the predominant soil type in your area or the location of farming activities/management practices. The selected option will appear darker to indicate that it has been selected. 

<br>

</p>
<br>

4. If the region you have selected has multiple hardiness zones, please select the appropriate option for your farm. The selected option will appear shaded to indicate that it has been selected. To see the list of hardiness zones, please click on the tab at the top that says, “Hardiness Zones”.

<br>

		<br>
		B: Please select your hardiness zone here.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

5. Each region you select has access to the climate data.  Holos will load the appropriate climate data by default should you choose to ignore this tab.  If you would like to load custom data, you can load your own data from a file with “**.csv**” extension.  Holos will confirm your custom data is loaded

	</em>
</p>
<br>

6. When you are finished selecting your soil type, hardiness zone and climate data, click “**Next**”.


<br>


## Formatting the custom climate data file

In order to import your own climate data into Holos, the file must be a Comma Separated Values (CSV) and have the “.csv” file extension. The file must also contain the following columns:

* **Year** – The year the climate data is from.
* **Julian day** – The day based on the Julian Calendar.
* **Mean daily air temperature** – The mean temperature of that day.
*	**Mean daily precipitation** – The mean precipitation of that day.
* **Mean daily potential evapotranspiration (PET)** – The mean potential evapotranspiration of that day.

## Single and Multi-Year Model

-	Holos works with a farm under two modes, **Single Year** and **Multi-Year.**  Basic Mode is just **Single Year** with some buttons and menus hidden for simplicity.  Holos starts any farm in **Single Year Mode (SYM)** by default.  As the name suggests **SYM** only gives data for a single year.  **Multi-Year Mode (MYM)** enables an **advanced carbon modelling system** over a period from 1985 to present.  
-	**SYM** is the simplest mode to use Holos, simply add components to your farm and press “Next” to load the results. This is the default mode when a new farm is created in Holos.
-	MYM changes the interface of certain components (see figure 4.6).

</p>
<br>

-	**MYM** will change the flow of Holos,  instead of the normal steps taken by **SYM**, in **MYM** you must add components to your farm and then navigate to the timeline screen. From that screen, depending on the settings, then go through the details screen and finally arrive at the results section.
-	You can toggle SYM or MYM in “**Settings**” or by clicking “**Yes**” beside “**Enable Multi-Year Mode**” in the component selection screen.
The bottom of Holos will display the current working mode either SYM or MYM.

### Shelterbelt Component

- A **Shelterbelt component** consists of rows of trees where each row contains various tree types such as Caragana, Green Ash, Hybrid Polar etc. 

- **A shelterbelt row can contain more than one tree type and for each tree type, there are data fields that should be filled in.**

- In this section, we will navigate step by step into how we can modify the data for a shelterbelt component to suit your operation.

- **If you have not created a shelterbelt component**, please click here [Introducing Component Selection](#introducing-component-selection) to learn how to add a component to your farm.


#### Setting Up the Shelterbelt

After adding a shelterbelt component, you have various options to configure this component.

1.	Enter the “**Year of Observation**” for your shelterbelt.
2.	By default, there is one row of trees in the shelterbelt when the component is added to your farm. **To add an additional row of trees, click “Additional Row”.**

<p align="center">

		C: A Shelterbelt row: row length and row name
		<br>
		D: A Tree type in a shelterbelt row
	</em>
</p>
<br>


#### Modifying the Shelterbelt Rows

-	**Each row in a shelterbelt consists of various tree type(s)** where **each tree type will have its own data fields** that need to be filled in as **shown in Figure 6.3**. **This will be covered in the “Modifying Tree Type Data Section”.**
-	Each row has a data field for the **Row Name and the Row Length(m)** and are located above each row as **shown in Figure 6.3**. 
-	By default, the row name will always correspond to the specific tree types in your shelterbelt row, but you have the option to customize the row name to suit your operation. For example, in figure 6.3, the first row in our shelterbelt consists of a caragana and hybrid poplar tree, therefore the row name will be automatically be adjusted to be “Caragana, Hybrid Poplar”.
-	**If you would like to add another tree type to one of your shelterbelt rows**, beside each shelterbelt row is a button called “**Additional Tree Type**”. 



#### Modifying Tree Type Data in a Shelterbelt Row

For each tree type in your shelterbelt row(s), there is a set of data fields that need to be filled corresponding to the shelterbelts on your farm.
1.	**Select the tree type** by clicking on the drop-down menu beside the “**Species**” tab. You will be shown a list of available tree types, select one.
2.	**Input the rest of the data corresponding to your tree type** which includes: average spacing between trees(m), number of trees and the average circumference(cm) and the tree type name. 
3.	If you do not know the average circumference for your tree type, click on the “Calculator” button beside the “Average Circumference” field. For more information on the Average Circumference Calculator,follow instructions in the next section titled, Average Circumference Calculator.

### Crop Rotation Component

A crop rotation component is similar to a field component and allows the representation of multiple field components on the farm. If a farm contains multiple field components that are added to represent the rotation of crops on a field over the years, a crop rotation component can represent the same information through a single entry. This allows for easier and more manageable representation of fields and crops on the farm.


<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter6/figure6-58.png" alt="Figure6-58" width="850"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 6.58 - Crop Rotation Component
	</em>
</p>
<br>


The crop rotation component allows to easily set the crop grown in a specific year and automatically sets the rotation based on the number of crops chosen.

<br>

## Animal Components

-	The animal components are separated into the following component categories: **Beef Production, Dairy, Swine, Poultry, Sheep, and Other Livestock.**
-	All the results for each animal component will be displayed on a **single results page.** 
-	However, each animal component requires their own set of data inputs!
-	In this section, we will go through how to enter data for each component category.

<br>

### Setting Up Animal Components

-	The animal component is very similar in terms of the structure and data required to create the components.
-	Each **animal component** consists of **one or more animal groups (e.g. heifers vs steers)**, where **each animal group has one or more management periods.**
- The **management period** is separated into categories and allows the user to enter data for **General, Diet, Housing and Manure** details for each **animal group.**

# Chapter 7 - Timeline


To view the Timeline, your farm must be in Advanced mode and enable Multi-Year Mode in the Component Selection Screen
- [Learn how to switch between Basic and Advanced modes](#how-do-i-enable-advanced-mode).
- [Learn how to enable Multi Year Mode](#how-do-i-enable-multi-year-mode)

The timeline screen allows you to see your farm over a period from 1985 to present day. The timeline screen is used for the following components:

- Farm crop system timeline
- Shelterbelt timeline


## Farm crop system timeline:

The farm crop system timeline is displayed when the farm is set to 'Multi-Year Mode'. The crop system timeline shows an overview of the crop(s) grown on the farm and allows the user to add historical and future projections to a particular field and its crop systems.

-	To **add a historical or projected production system** click on the field in the list of production systems under “**Step 1**” or by selecting the system in the timeline region.  
-	Once clicked the system is now active, click either “**Add Historical Production System**” or “**Add Projected Production System**”.
-	Adding a **historical production system** will create a new inline block with the original field at the **beginning of the timeline** while a **projected production system** places the new block at the **end of timeline.**

## Shelterbelt Timeline

The shelterbelt timeline works similarly to the farm crop timeline. The timeline shows the type of tree, the year it was planted and the cut-off year. The numbers at the top of the timeline signify the year. In the shelterbelt timeline you can adjust:

- The year the tree was planted.
- The cut-off year of the timeline.
- The year of observation.
- Number of trees alive today (from drop down named 'Mortality').

# Chapter 8 - Details

## Overview

-	To view this screen, ensure that you **enable Multi-Year Mode** while in **Advanced Mode** and **disable simplified results** in the toolbar.
-	This screen offers a detailed grid related to your farm’s fields like **carbon input**, **yield**, and **other factors** for each year of your production systems you created in the **timeline**.  
-	If you don’t know how to create a production system you can learn how by reading Timeline: Setup a Production System
-	We are first introduced to the “**data tray**” (see figure 8.1) on the left of the cropping system grid.  
	-	Clicking on “**Enable Columns**” to the left side of the data grid expands a tray of the available data columns.  
	-	Clicking “Enable Columns” again will collapse the tray to the side.
	-	 The tray allows you to show or hide different columns in the grid.  Your choice of what columns to hide will persist across sessions and farms (i.e. data columns hidden in one farm will also be hidden in other new and existing farms). 
	-	 The data is available in other views using the exact same functionality across each instance.
-	If you have come to this screen and then gone back to change something about your fields then you may have to reload the data to keep it up to date with your changes.  To accomplish the reload click “**Reload Data From Previous Screen**” in the upper left corner of the view.   
-	You can change how the screen reports the yields of your fields with the drop-down menu beside “**Yield Assignment Method**” **(default is “Average Yield”).**
-	Like other grids in Holos you can sort and filter each column shown.  Anything to the right of the Yield column can be edited by hand.

## Load an Input File

-	To assign load a file with custom yields in the results view of Holos, select the drop-down menu beside “**Yield Assignment Method**” and choose “**input file**”.
-	Click on the button that appears, labeled “**Load Custom Yield Data**”.
-	You will be shown a file explorer. Navigate to your input file.
-	The input file must be a **Comma Separated Value (CSV)** file.
-	The format of the file should be as follows:
	-	A column for the year, and as many columns as you have rotations.
	-	You can have as many years and rotations as you like in the file if they conform to the above format.
	- Note that you must separate the field name and rotation name by a hyphen for Holos to correctly associate the yield value with the appropriate field and rotation.


<div align="center">

| Year  | Field # 1 - Rotation #1 | Field #1 - Rotation #2 | ... |
| ----- | :---------------------: | :--------------------: | :-: |
| 1990  |          1065           |         1378           | ... |

# Chapter 10 - Command Line Interface

## What is a Command Line Interface

-	The Holos Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to efficiently process large amounts of data corresponding to the various operations on your Farm.
-	The interface requires the user to **create data input Excel files** for multiple farms and their respective components (i.e. fields, cow-calf, swine, etc.).
-	Excel files for data input should be saved using CSV format. **Microsoft Excel is recommended** since other third-party software (such as OpenOffice) is known to cause input errors.
-	Input files cannot be open in another program while the CLI is running. 
-	In this section, we will go through instructions on how to **set up the CLI**, how to **modify settings files**, how to **create data files for each Component and how to use the CLI.**

<br>
<br>

## Setting up the Command Line Interface
In this section, we will go through the steps to properly set up the CLI regarding: navigating the Holos directory, modifying the global settings files, creating/modifying data input Excel files and adding a new farm folder to the CLI,  for each of the Components in your farm.

### The CLI Farms Folder

- The Holos Command Line Interface requires the user to create a "Farms" folder where all farm related data will be stored.
- This Farms folder in a general folder that contains all individual farms that the user wants to work with.
- Each individual farm folder then contains different folders for each of the components in your farm as well as a global settings file for that farm (where you can set your global defaults for each farm). 
- Additionally, each component folder contains Excel files that store the data inputs for each of your operations (i.e., data input files for a field or a cow-calf component in your farm).

<br>

#### Creating a New Farms Folder

1. When you start Holos CLI, you will be prompted to enter the location of your "Farms" folder. This "Farms" folder can be located anywhere on your PC. After you specify your general Farms folder, Holos will create a default farm folder inside this general folder called called “HolosExampleFarm”.

	This default folder will contain multiple other folders for each of Holo's Components as well as a '**Farm.Settings**' file containing all settings related to this specific farm.

<br>
<p align="center">

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-3 - Default component folders created by CLI.
	</em>
</p>
<br>


You will then be prompted to import any farms from the Holos GUI version. Subsequent options will prompt you regarding further settings related to your Farms.

2. To create a proper template farm folder, Holos needs to know the units of measurement you would prefer. Please select Metric or Imperial when prompted.

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-4.png" alt="Figure10-4" width="750"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-4 - Prompt the select the Units of Measurement.
	</em>
</p>
<br>


3. The default template farm folder will be created in your specified directory. Press “enter” to allow the program to exit so you can create data input files for your farm(s). Navigate to the location to see your new farm folder.

	This default template Farm folder will contain all the necessary component directories, a settings file and template data files for each component for you to use to create your own farms

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-5 - Prompt after the default farm folder is created.
	</em>
</p>
<br>
	

Please note that if you have previously used the Holos CLI, after opening the CLI again you will be prompted to enter the location of the previously used "Farms" folder or select a new "Farms folder"

<br>

<br>


#### Add a New Farm to Existing Farms Folder:
How do I add a new farm to my current farms CLI folder
There are two methods to add a new farm to an existing farms folder. [The common questions section covers both methods.](#how-do-i-add-a-new-farm-to-my-current-farms-cli-folder)


#### Navigating through the Farms Folder:

1. By default, Holos will create an example farm folder in the Holos CLI “Farms” directory as shown below

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-2.png" alt="Figure10-2" width="650"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Default farm folder created by CLI
	</em>
</p>
<br>

2.	This example farm folder will automatically contain a list of folders corresponding to all the components that are available for use in Holos (i.e., fields, cow-calf etc.). As well as a settings file for that specific farm folder

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-3.png" alt="Figure10-3" width="650"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Default component folders created by CLI
	</em>
</p>
<br>

3.	Each of these component folders will all have a template data input Excel file that you can use as a reference to create additional data input files. Each data input Excel file represents one of that components whose folder we have chosen. 

	For example, if we are in the shelterbelts folder, each data input Excel file will represent one shelterbelt in your farm. So, if you have two shelterbelts in your farm, you will have two of these data input files.

<br>

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-6 - A template file representing a single component.
	</em>
</p>
<br>


### Modifying Settings Files

-	Each of your Farm Folders will have a settings file that will allow you to set the specific defaults such as Global Settings, Farm Defaults, Temperature, Precipitation, Evapotranspiration, Soil and Crop Defaults for that specific farm

1. Navigate to the farm folder whose default settings file you wish to modify.
2. In the selected farm folder, will be a file called “farm.settings”, open this file.
3. In the settings file, you can modify the default values for settings that are relevant to the operations in your farm such as:  Global Settings, Precipitation, Temperature, Evapotranspiration and Soil Defaults.
4. This settings file can be opened using any text editor e.g. Notepad.

<br>

    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-7 - Farm global settings file.
	</em>
</p>
<br>


### Modifying Component Data Input Excel Files

-	As mentioned above, each farm folder contains a list of folders that correspond to the available components that are available for use in Holos. Each of these component folders contains a template data input Excel file that you can **modify to suit the operations for each component in your farm.**
-	In this section, we will go through the guidelines for populating the data inputs for each of the component’s data input Excel files. **Each data input file should represent one of your components**. For example, if you have multiple shelterbelts on your farm, you will create a different data input Excel file **for each shelterbelt**.

<br>

#### Land Management Components

<br>

#### Shelterbelt Data Input Excel Files

-	**Row**: refers to the row in the Excel file
-	**Shelterbelt** row: refers to the row of trees in a shelterbelt
-	**Each row in the Shelterbelt data input Excel file can be split into three groups:**
	-	**Shelterbelt Data**: Hardiness Zone, Ecodistrict ID, Shelterbelt Name, Year of Observation
	-	**Shelterbelt Row Data**: Row Name, Row Length, Row ID, Plant Year, Cut Year
	-	**Tree Group Data**: Species, Planted Tree Count, Planted Tree Spacing(m), Live Tree Count, DBH 
-	If your shelterbelt row consists of more than one tree type, you would create an Excel data row that corresponds to each tree type that is a part of that shelterbelt row.

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-8.png" alt="Figure10-8" width="950"/>

		<br>
		A: Selterbelt Data.
		<br>
		B: Shelterbelt Row Data.
		<br>
		C: Tree Group Data.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

-	Below, we can see that both of the highlighted Excel rows are referring to the same shelterbelt row, the only difference is that **one Excel row refers to the tree type,** **caragana**, while the **other row refers to the tree type, green ash**. These two Excel rows together, represent the data for the shelterbelt row, “**Caragana, Green Ash**” which consists of the two tree groups where **each tree group has its own set of data, but they belong to the same row.**

<br>
<p align="center">

		<br>
		B: Both Excel rows refer to the same single-row shelterbelt (e.g. N of House, West side, etc.)
		<br>
		C: Both Excel rows refer to the same row id (meaning they are part of the same shelterbelt row) e.g. front, middle, back
		<br>
		D: These two Excel rows have a different species because the single-row shelterbelt consists of the two species: caragana and green ash where each species has its own set of data
	</em>
</p>
<br>

- For every single row of trees in a shelterbelt, please set a unique row ID

-	For multi-row shelterbelts, each row of trees will need a unique row ID please follow the same procedure as shown above to populate the rest of the Excel data input file. 
-	However, there are some inputs that accept different data values such as the “Hardiness Zone” and “Species”. 


<br>

##### Special Data Input Values
-	**Hardiness Zone**:  Naming convention follows “H(0-9)(a-b)”. For example, a valid hardiness zone would be “H3a” or “H3b” or “H9a”, where the first letter will always be “H” and for the subsequent number/letter, you can choose a range between 0-9 and either a or b to represent the appropriate hardiness zone for your farm.
-	**Species**: Caragana, Green Ash, Hybrid Poplar, Manitoba Maple, Scots Pine, White Spruce, Average Deciduous, Average Conifer.
- For more information about the Shelterbelt component, [Click here](#shelterbelt-component)


<br>

#### Field Data Input Excel Files

-	**Row**: refers to the row in the Excel file
-	**Field Crop Row:** refers to a row of Crops in the Field component
	-	Each row in the field data input Excel file can be split into 7 groups with the corresponding data:
-	**Field Data**: Phase Number, Field Name, Area(ha), Current Year
-	**Crop Row Data**: Crop Year, Crop Type, Tillage  Type, Year In Perennial Stand, Row ID, Perennial Stand Length(Years), Biomass Coefficient Product, Biomass Coefficient Straw, Biomass Coefficient Roots, Biomass Coefficient Extra roots, Nitrogen Content In Product (kg kg^-1), Nitrogen Content In Straw (kg kg^-1), Nitrogen Content In Roots(kg kg^-1), Nitrogen Content In Extra roots (kg kg^-1), Carbon Concentration (kg kg^-1).

<br>

-	**Each Excel row represents the data associated with ONE crop** (Crop, Manure, Cover Crop Data, etc.) and the Crop Row/Field the Crop the Crop belongs to (Crop Row\Field Data).

<br>

##### Perennial Crop

-	If the crop is **perennial, there are three important data fields that need to be filled properly**: Crop Year, Perennial Stand ID, and Perennial Stand Length (Years). 
-	Perennial stand ID takes on the form of 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000, where the zero’s can be any character you wish.  A simple stand ID might be 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001.
-	**To create a perennial stand length**, please create the appropriate row(s) for each year but **change the Crop Year and Year in Perennial Stand accordingly and refer to the appropriate Perennial Crop via the Perennial Stand ID**. (i.e. if we are referring to PerennialCrop1, and it has a Perennial Stand Length of four years, we will have four Excel rows that refer to the Perennial Stand ID of 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 but with different values for the Crop Year (2017, 2018, 2019 & 2020) and Year In Perennial Stand (1, 2, 3, 4)  and varying data values for the Crop’s Data. 
-	This is so that we can accurately group together the **perennial crop(s)** data for each year. 
-	**For each different type of perennial crop, please assign a unique perennial stand ID**. E.g. If the perennial stand was a mixed hay of smooth brome grass & alfalfa; smooth brome would have a unique perennial stand ID and alfalfa would have a unique perennial stand ID.
-	Therefore, for each of the perennial crops in your field, please follow the same procedure as shown above to populate the rest of the field Excel data input file. 
-	Look at Figures 10.10 - 10.14 for examples of Perennial Crop Data (Hay Grass).

<br>

##### Annual Crop

-	**If the crop is not a perennial crop**, please set the values for the Perennial Stand headers above to “N/A” and the stand ID to 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Populate the rest of the data columns appropriately for that crop.
-	Therefore, for each of the annual crops in your field, please follow the same procedure as shown above to populate the rest of the Field Excel data input file. 
-	Look at Figures 10.10 - 10.14 for examples of Non-Perennial Crop Data (Barley).

<br>

##### Special Data Input Values:

**Crop Type**:

- **Annual crops, Spring seeded**: 
 	- **Cereals** – Wheat, Barley, Oats, etc.
	- **Oilseeds** - Canola, Mustard, flax
	- **Pulses** – Soybean, Beans (dry field), Chickpea, etc. 
	- **Root crops** – Potato, Sugar Beets
	- **Corn** – Grain corn, silage corn 
	- **Cover crops** – Winter weeds, Rye, Hairy vetch, Hairy vetch + Rye
	- **Other** – Safflower, Sunflower seed, Tobacco, etc.
- Annual, Fall Seeded: 
	- Winter wheat

#### Animal Components

-	The animal components consist of **Swine, Beef, Dairy, Sheep, Poultry and Other Livestock** groups.
-	Animal components all **consist of different animal groups** 
-	Each animal group has its own management period(s) that consists of data for the **Diet, Housing and Manure** details **for one management period.**
-	**You can have multiple management periods for an animal group.** 
-	**If you have multiple management periods for an animal group**, please add another row referring to the same animal group (**same group name and group type**) but change the management period data accordingly.
-	**You cannot have two different animal types that belong to the same group**. For example: if you are looking at a swine component and you have one group called “SwineStartersGroup1”. This group cannot refer to more than one animal type (i.e. only Swine Starters, or Swine Finishers or Growers) – you can call the group anything you want, **an animal group cannot refer to more than one animal type.**
-	Some **animal components** will have some extra data that are specific to their animal type such as **Milk Production** for dairy animals or **Wool Production** for sheep.
-	In this section, we will go over the different types of animal components and their data files. 
-	**Below** is an example of the categories you will see in an animal component data file.
-	The headers **Housing Type** and **Manure Management** are only shown below as an example to make it easier to categorize. They will **NOT** be present in your data input files.

## Check List for Command Line Interface

-	The Command Line Interface requires the data inputs to be properly formatted and the appropriate components to be created for the data to be able to be processed. 
-	This section is a guideline for you to make sure that you do not encounter any errors when setting up the Command Line Interface.
-	 If you do encounter errors please click here: [Error Guide For The Command Line Interface](#error-guide-for-the-command-line-interface)

<br>

### Properly Filled Data Files
-	Fill according to the guidelines in the section: [How To Modify Component Data Input Excel Files](#modifying-component-data-input-excel-files)
-	**Remember that each file is a representation of one of the components in your farm**. For example, if you have two shelterbelts that you would like to represent as data input Excel files, you will need to create two data input Excel files, one for each shelterbelt and make sure their names are unique.
-	**Do not modify or remove the headers** of any of the data input Excel files or the Command Line Interface will stop processing.
-	**Fill in the data corresponding to the guidelines for each component**, there are **special headers that require specific data inputs** that you can choose from in each guideline. Make sure you spell your data inputs correctly!
-	**If you encounter one of these errors**, please navigate to the appropriate component guide under: [Modifying Component Data Input Files](#modifying-component-data-input-excel-files). Each of the sections will have a guide for the special data fields, indicating what data inputs are valid for that field.
-	**Do not input negative values where they do not make sense**. For example, if you set the “Year of Observation” to be “-1996”, the Command Line Interface will stop processing
-	**Do not leave data fields empty,** the command line interface will stop processing if there is no data.
-	**For some data fields, if the header is not applicable,  set the data input to be “N/A”**, for example in a field component, if you have an annual crop and you come across the headers “**Perennial Stand ID**”, “**Perennial Stand Length**” and “**Year in Perennial Stand**”, please set those fields to be “**N/A**”


<br>

### Unique Names for Components

For example, in the shelterbelts directory, if you have two Excel files: Shelterbelt1.csv and Shelterbelt2.csv and they both hold data for the component “ExampleShelterbelt1”, the Holos Command Line Interface will not process the data because their names are not unique.

<br>

### Valid References to Other Components

The user must ensure that the references to other components are valid and the component is actually a data file.

-	Make sure that if one of your component’s requires a reference to another component you have made, that the component you are referencing has the proper data input Excel file created in the appropriate farm and component folder and that you reference the component’s name (**NOT THE FILE NAME**) if you are required to refer to it in one of your data input fields for another component.
-	**For example**, in a **swine** component, you have selected the **Housing Type** to be “Pasture” and the pasture you would like to refer to is a custom field that reflects your farming operation. **Please make sure to create a data input Excel file with the data that reflects your custom field in the chosen farm’s fields folder** and make sure that the component name data field for each data input file is unique(**you cannot have components with the same name**).
-	Therefore, if the custom field component you have created has its **field name** set to “**FieldNameExample1**”, then whenever you would like to refer to that specific field in any component that can have a reference to a field, you would set the data field to be “FieldNameExample1”. 
-	As a result, for the pasture data field of the swine component, you would set the data input field to be “FieldNameExample1” if you would like to refer to that custom field.

<br>

### CLI Generated Cmponent Directory Names are not Changed

The user must ensure that they do not change the names of the component directories in each farm.

If the names of the component’s are not valid, the data will not be processed. You will be shown a message that will tell you which component directory is invalid.

<br>
<br>

## Error Guide for the Command Line Interface

-	This section will focus on the possible errors that can occur when you are creating your data input Excel files for each component.
-	The error message will always be displayed on the Command Line Interface and will tell you the row, column, and file where the error has occurred.
-	**If the Command Line Interface encounters any of the errors below, it will stop execution of the program until the issue is fixed.**

<br>

### General Data Input Errors

### One of the Data Values is Empty

1. Below is an example of an empty data value in a shelterbelt data input Excel file

	</em>
</p>
<br>

<br>

### Negative Values for Data Fields Where It Does Not Make Sense

1. Below is an example of a negative value for a data field in a Shelterbelt data input Excel file. It does not make sense for the Year of Observation to be -1996.

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-40.png" alt="Figure10-40" width="850"/>
    <br>

		<br>
		A: Invalid negative data value for year of observation
	</em>
</p>
<br>

2. If this error occurs, you will be shown a message on the Command Line Interface stating the invalid, negative data value and the row, column, and file where the error occurred.

<br>
<p align="center">

	</em>
</p>
<br>


### A Header Has Been Modified (Misspelled, Empty, Special Characters)

Please do not modify the headers in any of the component data input Excel files.

1. Below is an example of a header that has been modified – meaning it is empty or has been misspelled

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-42.png" alt="Figure10-42" width="950"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-42 - Example of an Invalid Header in a Shelterbelt Data Input Excel File
		<br>
		A: Invalid header value
	</em>
</p>
<br>

2.	If this error occurs, you will be shown a message on the Command Line Interface stating the location of the invalid header by the row and the file where the error occurred. You will also be shown the valid header that should be in that file.

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-43.png" alt="Figure10-43" width="650"/>
    <br>
    <em>

		<br>
		A: Invalid header value.
	</em>
</p>
<br>

### Unique Fields That Have Special Data Input Values

-	These errors are special because they **require specific data input values** and are **different for each component** (i.e. A shelterbelt component will have different fields than a field component, therefore the errors you may encounter will be different).
-	**If you encounter one of these errors**, please navigate to the appropriate component guide under: [Modifying Component Data Input Files](#modifying-component-data-input-excel-files). Each of the sections will have a guide for the special data fields, indicating what data inputs are valid for that field.

<br>

1. Below is an example of a special data field in the shelterbelt data input file that has been incorrectly entered. A “Hardiness Zone” can take a data value in the following format: “H(0-9)(a-b)”. Meaning the data values should always be preceded by an “H” and the subsequent numbers/letter can be any value within the specified range (0-9 or a-b).

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-44.png" alt="Figure10-44" width="850"/>
    <br>
    <em>
		Figure 10-44 - Example of an Invalid Special Data Input Value for Hardiness Zone in a Shelterbelt Data Input Excel File
		<br>
		A: Invalid hardiness zone value
	</em>
</p>
<br>

2. If this error occurs, you will be shown a message on the Command Line Interface stating the invalid, data value corresponding to a specific unique field, and the row, column, and file where the error occurred

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="../../Images/UserGuide/en/chapter10/figure10-45.png" alt="Figure10-45" width="650"/>
