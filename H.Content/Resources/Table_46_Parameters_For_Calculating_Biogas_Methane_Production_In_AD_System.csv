1 Values in bold indicate default averages used in Holos,,,,
2 "Total solids content for crop residues is equal to 100-Moisture content (%) * 10. See Table 7 for moisture content values for the following substrates (values are averages for all available precipitation+irrigation categories): barley straw (barley); corn silage; corn stover (grain corn); grass clippings (grassland (native)); grain corn; corn silage; oat straw (oats); oat silage; rye straw ((fall) rye); triticale straw (triticale); wheat straw (wheat)",,,,
3 "Sources for BMP, fCH4 and VS as follows: A – Bareha et al. (2021); B - Fen et al. (2017); C – Labatut et al. (2011); D - Carabeo-Pérez et al. (2021); E – Monch-Tegeder et al. (2013); F – Pham et al. (2013); G – Hutnan (2016); H – Dar et al. (2021); I – Schumacher et al. (2014); J - Ozbayram et al. (2021); K – Guérin et al. (2016); L – Kargwal et al. (2019); M – Bradna et al. (2016); N – McGuire et al. (1947)",,,,
4 "Default values were estimated based on comparable substrates for the following substrates/parameters: goat manure and horse manure - straw-based (fCH4); corn stover, corn silage, paddy straw, straw pellets, straw sample, sunflower residues, triticale straw, wheat straw and municipal sewage sludge (fCH4 and VS); used vegetable oil (fCH4)",,,,
5 The dry matter content of straw is derived from Ferraz et al. (2020) – see Table 30,,,,
