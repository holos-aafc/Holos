"Data on manure composition were organized from multiple publications based on Canadian studies (extension documents, reports, journal publications). Where data from Canada were not available, data were sourced from outside Canada – any non-Canadian data used is indicated in the relevant notes below.",,,,,,
"1 Moisture content and N, C and P content for beef cattle manure deposited on pasture were derived from unpublished data (provided by X. Hao, AAFC). For all other animals on pasture (dairy cattle, sheep and other livestock), the moisture content and C, N and P content values for beef cattle were used where needed, due to a lack of available data for these groups.",,,,,,
"2 Default values for moisture content and N, C and P content for deep bedding manure for beef cattle were averages calculated from data derived from the following sources: Paul and Beauchamp (1994); Hao et al.
